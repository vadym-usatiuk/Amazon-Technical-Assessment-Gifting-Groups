Gifting Groups

At Audible, a subscriber can gift an audiobook from
his/her library to any other non-subscriber to kick
start their audiobook journey. The first time
subscriber can receive up to a maximum of N
audiobooks from their friends/relatives. When a
non-subscriber receives an audiobook, we can infer
that the two may be related. Similarly, if the non-
subscriber receives gifted books from two other
subscribers, we can infer that all of them are
related and the three of them form a group. More
formally, a group is composed of all of the people
who know one another, whether directly or
transitively. Audible would like your help finding out
the number of such distinct groups from the input
data.
